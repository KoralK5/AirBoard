# AirBoard
A keyboard without keys which uses OpenCV to locate finger locations to predict key presses.

As of now, machine learning is not involved, but I plan to add it in the future to improve its accuracy.

## Keypress Detection

The keyboard can be completely removed after calibration.

## Calibration
Calibrator.py can be used to form an array of coordinates, each associated with a key.
